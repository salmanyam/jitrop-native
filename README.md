# jitrop-native
The project collects the gadgets and records the time to obtain gadgets from a process by utilizing an attack technique called Just-In-Time Return-Oriented Programming ([JIT-ROP](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6547134)). We utilize the JIT-ROP technique to evaluate different fine-grained address space layout randomization (ASLR) schemes and measure the upper bound of effective re-randomization intervals. [Our evaluation and measurements](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3372297.3417248) have been published in ACM CCS 2020. We implement a native version of the JIT-ROP technique. Please cite our paper if you utilize the source code of this repository.

We discuss how to use the native version of JIT-ROP as follows.


## Dependencies
The project uses capstone disassembler to disassemble raw data to instructions. Also, please make sure to download the build-essentials.

```
sudo apt-get install build-essential
sudo apt-get install libcapstone-dev
```

## How to build
The source code directory contains the Makefile to build the source codo. To build, just issue the ```make``` command. The ```make``` command will generate an executable named ```jitrop```.

## How to use
```
Usage: sudo ./jitrop -p <pid> -a <address> -o <operation> [-c <number of starting pointers> -executable_only]"
```
To execute the ```jitrop``` program, we need two required parameters: i) the pid of a running process, and ii) a leaked address from the process. Inside the ```nginx``` directory of this repository, we have modified the ```nginx``` program to leak the address of the ```ngx_getpid()``` function. We have compiled and built the executable program of the modified ```nginx``` program for testing.

To run the ```nginx``` server, just issue ```sudo ./nginx/sbin/nginx```. If the ```nginx``` program runs succesfully, it will output as follows.
```
The address of the function ngx_getpid() is = 0x7f06e17d1240
```
The leaked address will give us the leaked address that is necessary for running the ```jitrop``` program. In order to get the ```pid```, we need to issue the following command: ```ps aux | grep nginx```.

```
root       66983  0.0  0.0   4592   808 ?        Ts   Nov11   0:00 nginx: master process ./nginx/sbin/nginx
nobody     66984  0.0  0.0   5268  2804 ?        S    Nov11   0:00 nginx: worker process
```
If we choose the ```pid``` of the master process, then our ```pid``` will be 66983.

So, we have got the two required parameters to run the ```jitrop``` program. All the parameters of the ```jitrop``` program are described below.

```
-p <pid>: the pid of a process.

-a <address>: a leaked address from the address space of the process.

-o <operation>: what kind of output jitrop will produce.

-c <number of starting pointers> [optional]: jitrop picks a random code pointer from a code page of a process and 
starts the recursive code harvesting process from the code pointer. jitrop can do it multiple times from different 
code pages. How many times jitrop will repeat the process is specified by the -c <number of starting pointers> parameter.

-executable_only: jitrop can look for gadgets in the main executable as well as in the libraries. If we want to 
restrict jitrop to look gadgets only from the main executable, then we need to specify the -executable_only parameter.
```
The following command will output the starting addresses of all code pages from the address space of the ```nginx``` main process as well as all the number of gadgets from the Turing-complete gadget set found in the main executable of ```nginx```.

## Operations
We can get several types of output from the ```jitrop``` program as follows:
```-o 1```: Operation 1 outputs the time to collect all the gadgets from the Turing-complete gadget set.  
```-o 2```: Operation 2 outputs the time to collect all the gadgets from the priority gadget set.  
```-o 3```: Operation 3 outputs the time to collect all the gadgets from the MOV TC gadget set.  
```-o 5```: Operation 5 outptus the time to collect all the gadgets from a payload gadget set.  
```-o 6```: Operation 6 outputs the number of the gadgets from the priority gadget set.  
```-o 7```: Operation 7 outputs the number of the gadgets from the MOV TC gadget set.  
```-o x```: Operation x such that ```x < 1 && x > 7``` (i.e., any numbers execept 1-7), outputs the number of the gadgets from the Turing-complete gadget set.

Each line (except the last line) has the address of a code page and four numbers. The first, second, third, and fourth numbers represent the time to look for gadgets, the time to leak code pages, the time spent so far, and how many distinct types of gadgets the process collected so far. The operation 1 looks for gadgets from the Turing-complete gadget set and the total distinct types of gadget is 11. Thus process will stop looking for gadgets from the current starting pointer and restart the process from a different starting location. The last line has the summary information, i.e., the time to look for 11 types of gadgets.
